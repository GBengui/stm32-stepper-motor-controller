# STM32 STEPPER MOTOR CONTROLLER

# Overview

This repository contains the open hardware design files for stm32 Stepper motor controller. The control is made via RS485, the board use Allegroâ€™s A4988 microstepping bipolar stepper motor driver features adjustable current limiting, over-current and over-temperature protection, and five different microstep resolutions (down to 1/16-step). It operates from 8 V to 35 V and can deliver up to approximately 1 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air flow (it is rated for 2 A per coil with sufficient additional cooling).

# Repository structure:
